# Revenue Leakage Analysis (Service-Based Company)

## Overview
This project analyzes revenue leakage in a service-based company to identify financial loss and prioritize corrective actions.

## Business Problem
Service companies often lose revenue due to missed invoicing, excessive discounts, and delayed customer payments.

## Key Analysis
- Defined completed revenue as baseline
- Identified three leakage types:
  - Unbilled revenue (lost)
  - Excess discount beyond policy (avoidable)
  - Delayed payments (at risk)
- Performed regional and service-type breakdowns

## Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Power BI
- Excel

## Deliverables
- Power BI dashboard (.pbix)
- Project narrative (PDF)
- SQL logic file

## Notes
The dataset is simulated to reflect real-world service operations.
